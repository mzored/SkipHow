# Changelog

All notable changes to this project appear in this file.

## 0.8.0 (unreleased release candidate)

This candidate is not SkipHow 1.0. Authenticated Claude execution, multi-trial real provider and service outcomes, adaptive-routing ablation, and cross-platform operation remain `UNVERIFIED`.

### Changed

- Split the product into a lean semantic plugin kernel and an optional durable runner.
- Reduced the common software instruction route to 1,290 words and removed generic method skills from its default closure.
- Replaced single-item capture routing with batch Intake, raw-record and atom provenance, evidence status, bounded candidate decisions, grouping, work-item shaping, Epic dependency validation, and persistence authority.
- Expanded GitHub integration around candidate search, provenance, relationships, pull requests, checks, merge policy, and ownership-safe cleanup.
- Added project configuration schema v2 while retaining v1 reads and reversible explicit migration.
- Made the Intake CLI run grouping, work-item shaping, bounded candidate disposition, provenance merge, and optional Epic validation before idempotent persistence.

### Added

- Added the local Python runner with transactional SQLite state, an append-only journal, leases, checkpoints, recovery capsules, cancellation, circuit breaking, and state-derived reconciliation.
- Added foreground `execute` and single-frontier `worker` supervision, provider-session resume, lease renewal, persisted process-exit checkpoints, external-wait polling, and invocation time and reported-cost ceilings.
- Added redaction at the runner store boundary so run, task, event, finding, attempt, checkpoint, snapshot, and export payloads do not persist recognized secret forms.
- Added provider-neutral Codex and Claude adapters, Claude Agent SDK-first transport selection, subprocess fallbacks, context compaction, durable semantic routing and outcome calibration, permission profiles, protected-action checks, redaction, and a compare-and-swap audit chain.
- Added schema 2 runner migration with a consistent backup, hash-linked journal validation, exact-head snapshot recovery, and startup integrity checks.
- Added trusted environment verification for write-capable provider tasks and durable, replay-safe `github-deliver` reconciliation.
- Added versioned JSON schemas, durable CLI controls, twenty outcome scenarios, deterministic graders, and live eval harness v2 with exact-candidate release mode, isolated synthetic fixtures, trusted final-state collectors, grader-bound receipts, and failed-outcome aggregation.
- Added an executable substrate spike for child-process SQLite recovery and no-model Codex App Server terminate/resume continuity.
- Added an opt-in GitHub lifecycle gate for an owned disposable private repository. It requires a forced interruption and resume before it writes a gradeable receipt.
- Added architecture, trust, operations, intake, model-routing, GitHub lifecycle, eval, prior-art, and durable-runtime decision documents.

## 0.7.0

### Changed

- Replaced runtime reads of vendored upstream methods with compact, self-contained diagnosis, testing, technical review, and codebase design capabilities. Source copies, licenses, and pinned attribution remain source-only.
- Reduced every measured route closure. Common software routes are at least 23 percent smaller than v0.6; diagnosis and optional capability routes are at least 37 percent smaller.
- Made readiness, delegation lane contracts, operation health fields, review, and durable records conditional on the work that needs them.
- Added direct execution for non-software project artifacts inside the existing `CHANGE` intent, with source, render, or preview evidence suited to the artifact.
- Added verbatim request alignment, verification-gap checks, evidence-backed finding types, and precise in-scope completion semantics.
- Reworked repository outcome evals around correctness, mutation boundaries, required evidence, forbidden side effects, and separately reported economy signals.
- Replaced host-name assumptions with a semantic capability contract and single-agent fallback for bounded work.
- Split GitHub candidate search from semantic duplicate decisions, separated linked-branch creation from delivery provenance, and made Project status mapping explicit and optional.
- Corrected support documentation so CLI availability is not package proof and untested hosts or products remain `UNVERIFIED` or unclaimed.

### Added

- Added `scripts/context_budget.py`, a committed decreasing baseline, runtime-to-upstream lint, and CI ratchet for route context.
- Added `.skiphow/config.json` as the only optional config contract, with strict validation for tracker, Project, and campaign path settings.
- Added package-proof receipt handling to doctor, host capability profiles, 20 repository outcome scenarios, five policy mutations, multi-trial aggregation code, and a machine-readable live receipt format.
- Added campaign-only goal ancestry, budget envelopes, cancellation, idempotent lane claims, checkpoints, orphan recovery, and final reconciliation.
- Added lazy contracts for extensions, consequential behavior deltas, source-backed product decisions, and explicitly maintained verified project context.

### Removed

- Removed `.skiphow/config.yml`, `strict_lifecycle`, runtime upstream loading, implicit substring duplicate claims, and automatic Project status assumptions.
- Removed package-validated support claims that were not backed by a fresh receipt.

### Migration from 0.6

- If `.skiphow/config.yml` exists, move supported values to `.skiphow/config.json`, replace disabled Project values with `null`, and delete `strict_lifecycle`.
- GitHub adapter callers should use `find_candidates`, `create_linked_branch`, and `record_delivery`; Project status updates now require an explicit field and option mapping.
- Treat existing host support statements as historical only. Generate fresh package and live outcome receipts for the exact 0.7 candidate before publishing support claims.

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- Replaced the public workflow catalog with one conversational `skiphow` entrypoint for answer, capture, decision, change, repair, and continuation requests.
- Clear changes now execute from a lightweight delivery brief without mandatory shaping, tracking, Owner approval, product review, or acceptance receipts.
- Made extended product records, independent product review, and product acceptance conditional on consequential decisions or repository policy.
- Made GitHub Issues the optional default persistence integration and GitHub Projects an explicitly configured view.
- Replaced blocking preflight semantics with a read-only doctor that reports optional capabilities independently.
- Split deterministic local checks from optional host validation and added version consistency checks.
- Added activation, routing, repository outcome, forbidden-side-effect, and policy mutation eval coverage.
- Simplified dependency diligence and campaign state so optional fields and artifacts appear only when triggered.

### Added

- Added `.skiphow/inbox.md` as the local fallback for explicit capture requests with no configured tracker.
- Added narrow optional `github_issues.py`, `github_project.py`, and `doctor.py` adapters.
- Added a support matrix, privacy notes, diagnostics, update, rollback, and uninstall guidance.

### Removed

- Removed default lifecycle hooks and the monolithic GitHub lifecycle helper.
- Removed runtime handling of the legacy `Human Gate` Project field. Existing fields are left untouched and ignored.
- Removed separate public Codex skills and Claude wrappers for internal workflows.

## 0.5.0

### Changed

- Simplified technical routing to normal `EXECUTE`, focused `DIAGNOSE`, and durable `CAMPAIGN` paths.
- Replaced universal risk levels with concrete changed surfaces that determine evidence and review without selecting orchestration.
- Made tracking lazy, combined scope control with terminal finding dispositions, and limited revalidation to semantically invalidated evidence.
- Generalized completion and product-acceptance receipts from commit-only gates to exact delivered-state identities, with recovery guidance for existing campaign state.
- Focused subagents on context isolation, independent review, and genuinely parallel work instead of label-driven ceremony.
- Made GitHub Issues the durable work identity and a minimal Project the default human-facing queue, with Issue-only degraded operation and no mandatory `Human Gate` schema.
- Added vertical-slice and fog-of-war campaign decomposition, strict domain-glossary and ADR thresholds, and a verified human-action handoff.

### Added

- Added disposable `prototype` and intent-preserving `resolving-merge-conflicts` capabilities.
- Added `setup` for reusing or bootstrapping the standard minimal GitHub Project.

## 0.4.0

### Added

- The internal `cto` controller for direct, tracked-direct, or durable technical delivery.
- Internal testing, technical-review, and codebase-design capabilities adapted from pinned MIT sources.
- Product Director acceptance for user-visible Product Contract work.
- A read-only `preflight` workflow for local tools, GitHub authentication, board schema, hooks, and host commands.
- A 24-scenario behavioral corpus, a structured Codex runner, and one deterministic release-verification entrypoint.

### Changed

- `develop`, `fix`, and technical maintenance now route through the CTO instead of treating `cto-run` as all technical execution.
- Risk controls validation and review depth. Durability controls whether work uses `cto-run`.
- CI now runs package metadata, YAML, source, Markdown-link, behavioral-corpus, repository-test, and whitespace checks through `scripts/verify_release.py`.
- Python 3.10 or newer is now the documented minimum for the bundled lifecycle helper.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- The internal `github-task` lifecycle adapter for tracked GitHub work.
- Portable Codex and Claude Code hooks for linked-branch status and compact Project v2 operations.

### Changed

- `fix`, `develop`, and `cto-run` now decide when GitHub tracking applies before handing lifecycle work to `github-task`.
- GitHub lifecycle no longer selects implementation methods, test policy, review depth, or verification cadence.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- The `skiphow`, `idea`, `shape`, `develop`, `fix`, and `diagnose` skills.
- Adaptive defect routing through direct repair, internal diagnosis, bounded product decisions, or durable CTO campaigns.
- Product Contract review and immutable delivery campaign guidance.
- Claude Code adapters for every shipped skill.

### Changed

- Claude Code now loads the full SkipHow skill adapter directory.
- `diagnose` is now an internal capability used only when the cause is unclear.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- The `cto-run` skill for explicit, durable software campaigns.
- Codex and Claude Code plugin adapters.
- Repository contract tests, contributor policy, and CI.
