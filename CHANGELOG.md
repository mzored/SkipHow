# Changelog

All notable changes to this project appear in this file.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- The internal `github-task` lifecycle adapter for tracked GitHub work.
- Portable Codex and Claude Code hooks for linked-branch status and compact Project v2 operations.

### Changed

- `fix`, `develop`, and `cto-run` now decide when GitHub tracking applies before handing lifecycle work to `github-task`.
- GitHub lifecycle no longer selects implementation methods, test policy, review depth, or verification cadence.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- The `skiphow`, `idea`, `shape`, `develop`, `fix`, and `diagnose` skills.
- Adaptive defect routing through direct repair, internal diagnosis, bounded product decisions, or durable CTO campaigns.
- Product Contract review and immutable delivery campaign guidance.
- Claude Code adapters for every shipped skill.

### Changed

- Claude Code now loads the full SkipHow skill adapter directory.
- `diagnose` is now an internal capability used only when the cause is unclear.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- The `cto-run` skill for explicit, durable software campaigns.
- Codex and Claude Code plugin adapters.
- Repository contract tests, contributor policy, and CI.
